## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby

### Setup
> You'll need a config folder/directory with the auth keys for both twitter and bitly. It's highly advised that you follow the entire setup.

#### Github
- Create a new folder/directory for the project
- Be sure to have a Github account and that this account is connected locally on your PC

#### Twitter 

You're going to need auth keys for this. If you already know how to do it, just jump to the next section.

<details><summary>Setting up Twitter for Devs</summary>
<p>

#### Create an account/Login into [Twitter for Developers](https://developer.twitter.com/)
#### You'll have to fill a form with the reason behind your requesting for creating a developer account
#### Create a new project by going into 'Projects & Apps' > 'Overview'
![Twitter 1](./img/twitter_img/twitter1.png)
#### Then clicking on the 'Create App' button
![Twitter 2](./img/twitter_img/twitter2.png)
#### Type the desired app name and click 'Complete'
![Twitter 3](./img/twitter_img/twitter3.png)
#### Ignore the keys for now. Go right ahead to the 'App settings'
![Twitter 4](./img/twitter_img/twitter4.png)
#### Click on the 'Edit' button of the 'App permission' settings - your app is going to tweet, so it needs POST auth as well!
![Twitter 5](./img/twitter_img/twitter5.png)
#### Select 'Read + Write + Direct Messages' and hit 'Save'
![Twitter 6](./img/twitter_img/twitter6.png)
#### Now on the top of the dashboard, go to the 'Keys and Tokens' tab

#### Regenerate both API key & secret and Access Token & secret - **REMEMBER TO NEVER SHARE THEM**

## Now, go to your project folder/directory
#### Create a folder/directory named `config`
#### Create a file named `twitter_auth.rb`
#### Paste this code below, but remember to change YOUR_KEY with the according key:

```ruby
module Trendvices
  class TwitterAuth
    attr_reader :api_key, :api_secret_key, :access_token, :access_token_secret

    def initialize
      @api_key = 'YOUR_KEY'
      @api_secret_key = 'YOUR_KEY'
      @access_token = 'YOUR_KEY'
      @access_token_secret = 'YOUR_KEY'
    end
  end
end

```

#### IMPORTANT: NEVER COMMIT THE CONFIG FOLDER TO A PROJECT!!!

#### Medium
- Nothing has to be done here, since it's just a simple data scraper. Medium is just the Article website that we scrape the data from. It's both the HTTParty and the Nokogiri that are doing the heavy lifting here.


### Install

If you want to make sure that all of the gems used are included (to avoid any errors later on):
- `gem install twitter`
- `gem install bitly`
- `gem install httparty`
- `gem install nokogiri`

Run these commands in this order:

To clone the project into your computer:
- `git clone https://github.com/fernandorpm/trendvices.git`

Go to the newly created directory/folder:
- `cd trendvices`

To install the gems from the Gemfile:
- `bundle install`

### Usage

Creating a robot for twitter that is able to scrap data. It can be changed to interact with twitter in many different ways. Please refer to the [Twitter Developer Documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

### Run

On the folder/directory of the project:
- `bin/main.rb`

### Test

In order to run the tests, first you have to have the rspec gem installed in your PC.
For that, run `gem install rspec`

Then you can check if the rspec was succesfully installed by running `rspec --version`.

Finally, just as for the previous steps, you have to go to the project location on your computer.

Then, you have to go to the testing folder (`cd testing`) and run `rspec`.

You can manipulate and check the tests on the following files, located in ./testing/spec:
- `bitly_manager_spec.rb`
- `medium_manager_spec.rb`
- `twitter_manager_spec.rb`
